An interactive web-based simulation of hierarchical promotions and organizational efficiency, inspired by:

> Pluchino, Alessandro, Andrea Rapisarda, and Cesare Garofalo. "The Peter principle revisited: A computational study." Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 389.3 (2010): 467-472.

## Overview

This simulator visualizes how different promotion strategies affect the efficiency of hierarchical organizations, based on the Peter Principle:

> "Every new member in a hierarchical organization climbs the hierarchy until he/she reaches his/her level of maximum incompetence."

Through agent-based modeling, this tool allows you to explore how promotion strategy and competence transmission mechanisms influence the system over time.
